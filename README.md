## YouTube Downloader with Python

---

- **This is a console application you can use it to download what you want from YouTube with the required quality.**

- **In this project I used python with the help of [Pytube](https://python-pytube.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) Library**

- Also I used **Exception Handling** concept to avoid Errors and users faults.

- With this Application you can download a playlist too
